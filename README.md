# Kiddie Roster
The names of new students trickle in the closer we get to a new school year; we need to keep track of them all! 
Let's keep track of kids in a class, inclusive of:
- the kids (otherwise, what's the point?)
- a class of kids' teacher

## Description
A teacher adds a child's name to the database once he/she is aware of the new student.  These are little kids (primary school) so, one teacher per a class of students is all that is necessary to teach daily lessons.  

There is a possibility that there are unassigned children - maybe an office admin knew a child would attend, but didn't know his/her teacher at time of entry.  A teacher can also assign an unassigned child to his or her class.

If there is an unassigned child come the new school term, someone's doing int wrong... :grimacing:
