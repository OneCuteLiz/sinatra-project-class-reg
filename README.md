# Kiddie Roster
The names of new students trickle in the closer we get to a new school year; we need to keep track of them all! 
Let's keep track of kids in a class, inclusive of:
- the kids (otherwise, what's the point?)
- a class of kids' teacher

## Description
A teacher adds a child's name to the database once he/she is aware of the new student.  These are little kids (primary school) so, one teacher per a group of students is all that is necessary to teach daily lessons.  

If there is an unassigned child come the new school term, someone's doing it wrong... :grimacing:

## Possibilities to Make Better

This is strictly from the P.O.V of one individual - the teacher. 
What about from an Admin's P.O.V? 

A new student can be enrolled into the school via an Admin who enters said child into some roster without assigning a teacher. In this case: unassigned kids are a possibility and it'd be the responsibility of the teacher to assign a child to him/herself at a later time. 

Maybe same Admin person wants to know all the classes within the school, each class' teacher and kids within the class. In this case, refactoring the code to add a "Class" Model, corresponding controller and views to handle class CRUD operations, and join table may be needed. 
Having an inventory of all that exists in the school is the goal of the Admin here.
